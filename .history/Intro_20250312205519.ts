//============================= Difference between Typescript & JavaScript =============================>
/**
    * 1. Typescript is a superset of javascript.
    * 2. Typescript is a statically typed language.
    * Statically typed language: A language in which the type of a variable is known at compile time. For example: C, C++, Java.
    * 3. Typescript is a compiled language.
    * 4. Dynamically typed language: A language in which the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. For example: Python, Ruby, JavaScript.
    * 5. Typescript is a open source language.
    * 6. Typescript is a object oriented language.
    * 7. compilation = Typescript Needs to be compiled to JavaScript.  Javascript Directly run in the browser. Javascript Directly Executed by the browser and node.js will run the javascript code.
    * 8. error checking = compile time error checking in typescript.  runtime error checking in javascript.
