//============================= What is Typescript ==========================>
/*
    1. A strongly typed superset of the javascript.typescript is a language that builds on javascript by adding syntax for type.
    2. Typescript is a language that builds on javascript by adding syntax for type.
    3. Add Static typing to the language and other features too.
    4. Provide better error checking, enhanced tools, improved code readability and maintainability.

//============================= Difference between Typescript & JavaScript =============================>
/**
    * 1. Typescript is a superset of javascript.
    * 2. Typescript is a statically typed language.
    * Statically typed language: A language in which the type of a variable is known at compile time. For example: C, C++, Java.
    * 3. Typescript is a compiled language.
    * 4. Dynamically typed language: A language in which the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. For example: Python, Ruby, JavaScript.
    * 5. Typescript is a open source language.
    * 6. Typescript is a object oriented language.
    * 7. compilation = Typescript Needs to be compiled to JavaScript.  Javascript Directly run in the browser. Javascript Directly Executed by the browser and node.js will run the javascript code.
    * 8. error checking = compile time error checking in typescript.  runtime error checking in javascript.
    * 9. code readability = typescript code is more readable.  javascript code is less readable.
    * 10. Support for OOP = Better Support for interfaces, classes and generics. Basic support with prototype based oops.
    * 11. Learning Curves = Higher Due to Static Types and additional features. javascript easier to learn as its simpler and more flexible.
    * 12. code scalability = Better for large codebases.  Not suitable for large codebases.
    * 13. code scalability = easiers to scale with static types, interfaces, and strong typing. javascript more challenging to scale due to dynamic typing.
    * 14. code maintenance = Easier to maintain due to static types and OOP features.  More challenging to maintain due to dynamic typing.
    * 15. Use case = Suitable for large, complex applications. Ideal for smaller projects and fast prototyping.
    * 16. Interoperability = Can be used with existing javascript code. Can be used with existing javascript code.
    * 17. Interoperability = Can use javascript libraries and code. javascript fully interoperable with typescript.
    * 18. Development speed = slower due to type checks and compiling
